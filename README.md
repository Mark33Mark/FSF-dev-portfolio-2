### 1. Description  
**What is this project?**  
* An updated version of my portfolio webpage created in week 2 of the Bootcamp Course.  This project provides potential employers with samples of my work for them to assess if I'm a good candidate for an open position.  

**Why this project?**  
* To find employment it is essential to have a good portfolio of professional materials to demonstrates my capability as a developer.

**What problem does this project solve?**  
* Provides a polished mobile responsive website to canvas my capability with links to my Github and LinkedIn for potential employers to consider me for a job.

**Lessons learnt?**  
* Whilst I've improved with my implementation of ideas I need to improve with agreeing very early in the process what ideas are realistic for an MVP / assignment satisfying criteria.  I find I lose a lot of time playing with challenging ideas and then panic near the deadline that I'm not going to get an MVP that I'm at least happy with.
* A minimalist design is probably more work than a noisy busy page.  So much additional thought in styling is needed to work out how to handle elements to achieve minimalism.
* I spent a lot of time looking at a couple of alternative CSS frameworks, came close to using Bulma but decided to go it on my own.  I'm glad I did as there are convenient tools in the frameworks that I can easily build myself.
* GitHub does not provide PHP and they refer you to FormSpree.  I spent a bit of time on a PHP file that worked as I tested it on my host site only to find out that GitHub don't offer it.  The free, like all the free services, is a bit limited.  There is an auto-respond function / plugin but you need to pay minimum $8 per month for it.  I'm not doing it as I have the ability through my host site to do it.  Anyhow, users via the GitHub deployed site can still fill in the form and I'll receive their email, they just won't receive an auto-response.

I tried Bulma CSS framework for this assignment as an alternative to Bootstrap.  I found it worked well.
Thanks dcode for your youtube explaining how to use Fetch for POST commands - meant I could hook my email form up to my email server using a little php.

### 9. Tests  
- Opened on a Samsung Note 10+ and experienced full functionality and responsive behaviour was as expected.
- Opened on a Apple iPhone X - buttons not working or tooltips.  Swept my CSS with Autoprefixer but behaviour unchanged.  Did a web search and could not find any reasonable solutions, one site suggested moving buttons higher with z-index property but didn't try as it seems illogical and will interfere with the fixed navigation header.
